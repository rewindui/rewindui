## Contributing guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We appreciate your time and effort in making this project better.

## Tech stack

Rewind-UI is built as a [monorepo using Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/what-is-a-monorepo) on top of the following amazing projects:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [CVA](https://cva.style)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Floating-UI](https://floating-ui.com/)

Basic animations are implemented using the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API). For more complex animations we use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

Before you get started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Local development

After cloning the repository, you can run the following commands:

- [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) globally: `npm install -g pnpm`
- Install repository dependencies: `pnpm install`

Having installed the dependencies, you need to start the dev servers for each package/app:

### @rewind-ui/core

Open the `rewindui/packages/core` directory and run `pnpm dev` to start the development server on the core package.

### Storybook

Open the `rewindui/apps/storybook` directory and run `pnpm dev` to start the Storybook server.
Storybook is used to develop and test components in isolation.

### Testing

Component tests leverage [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and are co-located with component implementations. New components should include functional tests that cover how a user would interact with them.

To run the test suite once, run `pnpm run test`.

To run the test suite in watch mode, run `pnpm run test:watch`.

### Documentation

Open the `rewindui/apps/docs` directory and run `pnpm dev` to start the documentation server.

## Project structure

The structure of each component should be as follows:

### @rewind-ui/core

Each component should be in its own directory inside `rewindui/packages/core/src/components`. The [Button](https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui/tree/main/packages/core/src/components/Button) component can be used as an example.

The component directory should contain the following files:

- `index.ts` - exports the component and its types
- `Component.tsx` - contains the component logic
- `Component.types.ts` - contains the component types
- `Component.tests.tsx` - contains the component tests

The CVA file of each component should be placed in `rewindui/packages/core/src/theme/styles/Component.styles.ts` and should also be exported from `rewindui/packages/core/src/theme/styles/index.ts`. The `theme.context.tsx` file will need to be adjusted to include the new component.

Each component should be exported from `rewindui/packages/core/src/index.ts` as well.

### Storybook

To add a new component to Storybook, add a new story file in `rewindui/apps/storybook/stories` and import the component from `@rewind-ui/core`.

### Documentation

It is recommended to submit your pull request without documentation changes. If the new component is accepted, the documentation will be updated by the maintainers.
