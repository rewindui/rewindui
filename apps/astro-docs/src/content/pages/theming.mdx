import { Callout } from "@components/Callout";

Rewind-UI theming system is built on top of [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/docs) library. Please make sure you are familiar with the CVA library before proceeding.

# Customization
---
The default theme can be easily customized by passing the new theme object to the `ThemeProvider` component.

To store your custom styles it is suggested to create a `theme` directory into your project containing a `styles` subdirectory.

```
public
src
theme
├── styles
│   ├── Button.styles.ts
```

Then, you can copy all or some of the default styles from the [@rewind-ui/core](https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui/tree/main/packages/core/src/theme/styles) package and customize them as you wish. Finally you can import them into your `App.tsx` file and pass them to the `ThemeProvider` component.

<Callout>Don't forget to adjust your tailwind.config.js file to include the new theme/styles files!</Callout>

```tsx
import {
  Button,
  ThemeContextType,
  useTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
} from '@rewind-ui/core';
import './App.css'
import { buttonStyles } from './theme/styles/Button.styles';

function App() {
  const defaultTheme = useTheme();

  const themeContext: ThemeContextType = {
    theme: {
      components: {
        ...defaultTheme.components,
        Button: buttonStyles,
      }
    },
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ThemeProvider value={themeContext}>
        <Button color="blue">Blue</Button>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
